## Objective

My main objective of this website is to use HTML and CSS efficiently in order to create a responsive static website with pleasing aesthetics and intuitive functionality.

## Features
### Existing Features

- Logo & Navigation Bar

![logo-navbar-desktop](assets/docs/logo-navbar-header.png "logo-navbar")

The responsively designed logo and navigation bar with the background image appear in all three pages of the website in order to facilitate intuitive navigation for the user.

- Quote section

![quote-section-home](assets/docs/quote-section-home.png "quote")

The quote section is placed between the header of the page and an upcoming reads section. It mainly has decorative purposes and a function of creating a cozy atmosphere and to provide a smooth transition between the navigation section and the also busy upcoming reads section.

- Upcoming section

![upcoming](assets/docs/upcoming-snippet-home.png "upcoming-reads")

The upcoming section contains a snippet of the full list of reads that's planned for the book club for 2023. It serves as an appetizer for the user to get into the vibe of the community. The list contains three images with links to the online bookstore that the book club is theoretically collaborating with and a few lines about each book. That text becomes hidden in smaller screens since it becomes too busy with all the text on a mobile screen and the user can reach the same information on the bookstore's website as they click on the link.
The background image functions to present the atmosphere of the community.

- Footer

![footer-social](assets/docs/footer-social.png "footer-social-links")

The footer contains the social links to the book club's theoretical Facebook and Instagram pages. The links open in a new tab which allows an easier navigation for the user.

- Calendar page

![meetup-membership-info-calendar](assets/docs/meetup-info-calendar.png "meetup-membership-info-calendar")

The calendar page contains all the technicalities the user should know about the book club. It contains information about how to join, when and where the meeetups are held. The text in italic provide links to the relevant pages for the user.

![calendar-full-book-list](assets/docs/calendar-page.png "calendar-full")

This section follows the same style as the "appetizer" section on the Home page. It contains a clickable image of the book cover and an introductory text about the book itself, as well as the date of the meetup when this read will be discussed by the members.
Just as the other section on the Home page, these texts will also be hidden on smaller screen sizes, leaving the user with a clear and relevant information about the reads and meetup dates.

![calendar-map](assets/docs/map-calendar.png "map")

The embedded responsive Google Maps provides clear information about the location of the meetings.

- Join Us page

### Future Features

A Blog page is left to implement where each month a member can write about their impressions and experience with our read of the month. 

## UX Design



### Wireframes

![wireframe-homepage](assets/docs/wireframe-mockup.png "wireframe-homepage")

### Colors

### Fonts

Since it's a website related to books, it was important for me to use fonts that are usually used in books as well.
Thus all text has **Eb Garamond** as font-family and the logo got **Tangerine**.
I imported these from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

### Logo

### Navigation bar

### Hero image

### Footer



## Technologies used

## Bugs

Bug: The embedded Google Maps only took up one-third of the screen, and even when I added - center center no-repeat - it got aligned to the middle but left some whitespace on the sides.

Fix: I removed the centering and the no-repeat constraint and set the width to 100%.
