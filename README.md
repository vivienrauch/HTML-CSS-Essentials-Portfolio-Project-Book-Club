## Objective

My main objective with this website is to use HTML and CSS efficiently in order to create a responsive static website with pleasing aesthetics and intuitive functionality.

## UX Design

### Colors

### Fonts

Since it's a website related to books, it was important for me to use fonts that are usually used in books as well.
Thus all text has **Eb Garamond** as font-family and the logo got **Tangerine**.
I imported these from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

## Bugs

Bug: The embedded Google Maps only took up one-third of the screen, and even when I added - center center no-repeat - it got aligned to the middle but left some whitespace on the sides.

Fix: I removed the centering and the no-repeat constraint and set the width to 100%.
